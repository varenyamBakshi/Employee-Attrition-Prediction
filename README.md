# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
As the COVID-19 keeps unleashing its havoc, the world continues to get pushed into the crisis of the great economic recession, more and more companies start to cut down their underperforming employees. Companies firing hundreds and thousands of Employees is a typical headline today. Cutting down employees or reducing an employee salary is a tough decision to take.

## Aim 
To predict Employee Attrition by the given data about his/her past history.

## Packages used
Numpy, Pandas, IPython, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
